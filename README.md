# Personal Information Manager

## Project Description
This is my first Python project. It is a simple program that stores and displays personal information using variables, user input, validation, and formatted output.

## Features
- Stores static information (name, age, city, hobby)
- Gets dynamic information from user (favorite food, color)
- Displays all information in a formatted way
- Performs basic input validation
- Calculates age in months

## What I Learned
- Using variables and data types
- Taking input from users
- Formatting output using f-strings
- Validating user input using conditions

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Open terminal / command prompt
3. Navigate to the project folder
4. Run:
   ```bash
   python personal_info.py
